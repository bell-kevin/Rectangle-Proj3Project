# Rectangle-Proj3Project
SDEV 1060 Project. 


In the previous project, you added a third method (volume), added a test for that new method,  and ran all tests 5 times, once for each test case.  

In this project, add 5 more tests to the test cases, be sure to add them to your test case document as well.  

Rather than running the tests 10 individual times, once for each test case, add assertions for all 10 test cases to each test method. 

See the reading "Running More Tests" to see how to add assertions.  

Take screenshots showing successful completion of all test cases. Take screenshots of the testing methods with multiple assertions.  

Submission: document with the test cases, screenshots of results of the passing tests, screenshots of the testing methods, and the root folder for the project  


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==  

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software (FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub to develop our FOSS project.  We have an [open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.  If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please [check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without using GitHub directly.  Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's code in Copilot.  ![Logo of the GiveUpGitHub campaign](https://sfconservancy.org/img/GiveUpGitHub.png)
